# Convex-Hull
Convex Hull visualize solver 
# To-do
- [ ] Make a container div that has an input section for custom structuring elements
- [ ] add support for don't care elements which will need different implementation for hitOrMiss (using erosion)
- [ ] show the structuring element number beside the iteration number
- [ ] any optimization (e.g. using observer pattern / signals for rendering automatically)
